What we know about Hong Kong's deadly high-rise fire
DMW Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac said authorities are still verifying whether or not the OFW was inside the buildings when the “inferno” set eight buildings ablaze afternoon of Nov. 26.
“That is the report. But we don't know for sure about her exact whereabouts. So the search continues. I don't want to speculate as to where she is exactly,” Cacdac told ANC’s Headstart.
The secretary said the DMW and other concerned agencies are already in communication with her family members in the Philippines.
The DMW's database recorded 83 Filipinos residing in the inflamed Wang Fuk Court residential estate, but Cacdac said they accounted for 37 with addresses in the complex.

The Philippine and Hong Kong authorities are still tracking whether or not the 37 Filipinos were inside the buildings during the fire.
“It's difficult to speculate at this stage whether those who are in our database with the same address were in the facility, the towers, at the height of the fire or during the fire when it broke out at 2.51 p.m. two days ago. So we just are careful not to say that they were inside the premises,” he said.

Government agencies earlier reported that at least 23 OFWs were affected by the Hong Kong high-rise fire, including one Filipina who is currently recovering in a hospital’s intensive care unit due to carbon monoxide inhalation. The Filipina is recovering and is in stable condition.

“I've been told as of last night that she is stable and on the way to recovery. And we hope it stays that way. And we are, we too are in touch with her family here in the Philippines,” he said.
He said the government is providing basic needs assistance, including food, water, clothing and others, for the affected Filipinos who lost their homes and belongings to the fire.
Cacdac noted that the OFWs’ major problem is their burnt passports and contracts.
But he assured that the DMW may provide copies of their contracts, and will coordinate with Hong Kong authorities to deal with the issue.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Consulate General in Hong Kong will also assist the affected Filipinos’ restoration of travel documentation.
Well-being and health aside, Cacdac assured there will be no hurdle for them to continue working in Hong Kong.
DFA says no Filipinos injured, dead from massive Hong Kong fire 'at this time'
He added that psychosocial counseling will also be provided to the Filipinos to help them deal with the trauma brought by the incident.
“So we will be there alongside the Hong Kong authorities and the PCG, of course, to provide the necessary assistance with respect to their health and their well-being and even psychosocial counseling,” Cacdac said.
Meanwhile, the secretary reported that no Filipino casualties have been recorded so far.
The fire has taken

A huge fire ripped through several high-rise blocks in a Hong Kong residential estate on Wednesday, killing at least 44 people.
Hundreds more remained unaccounted for in the city's worst blaze in decades.
The fire which started on Wednesday afternoon in an eight-building complex with 2,000 apartment units shocked the Chinese financial hub, which has some of the world's most densely populated and tallest residential blocks.
The DFA said efforts by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department to contain the fire are still ongoing.
""Due to the scale and intensity of the fire, it will take time before the extent of the damage and number and nationality of the victims are fully determined,"" it said.
