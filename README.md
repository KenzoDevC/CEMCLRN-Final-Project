# CEMCLRN-Final-Project
To run tier 1:
---

Download credentials.txt from the group chat. This allows the program to send files to the GDrive folder without authenticating the user.

Place the file in the same folder as disaster_scrape.py. Then in command prompt, install the needed python libraries, then type the command:

`python disaster_scrape.py`

The google drive folder can be accessed using [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CK-3noRfwvlntTZyidVAOQgJ26pbAlnn), and the google colab notebook [here]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19_dJkISaPtQXcpQLS8C2u4RTPsNHp-k8?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PUMYZ9WdbkKYWXgcSvspzXtLcqiM9vkN?usp=sharing)).
